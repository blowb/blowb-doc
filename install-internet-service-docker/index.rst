Install Internet Service Software in Docker Containers
======================================================

In this chapter, we will install Internet service software with which users directly interact, such as
file/contact/calendar syncing (ownCloud), information publishing (Wordpress), instant messaging (XMPP), etc. None of
these software is essential, so you can choose to install only the ones which you need.
