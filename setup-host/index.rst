In this chapter, we will set up the host system, the server system on which we will deploy all the services. Red Hat
Enterprise Linux (RHEL)/CentOS 7.x (7.2 or later) is assumed to be the host operating system throughout this chapter,
but it is also possible to set up the host system with other GNU/Linux distributions (see :doc:`others` for details).
