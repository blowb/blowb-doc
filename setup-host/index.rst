Set up the Host System
======================

In this chapter, we will set up the host system, which is the server system which we will build all the service. You are
assumed to use RHEL/CentOS 7.x (7.1 or later) throughout the whole chapter, but it is also possible to set up the host
system with other GNU/Linux distributions (see :doc:`others` for details).
