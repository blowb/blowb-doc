At the age of the Internet, we use Internet services everyday: We use Google Hangout to communicate; we use Facebook to
share stories; we use Chrome Sync to synchronize browser bookmarks. They are pretty cool, but do you know

  - that they collect your data, even private data, for the purpose to "improve" your experience;
  - that they tie you to their platforms and your friends have to be also tied to the platform to be with you;
  - that they control what stories you "should" publish and what stories you "should not" publish.

It looks like the Internet is owned by service providers, not by you. So what can we do, the people who live in the
Internet age?

**We can take the Internet back.** There are many Internet related `free software`_ projects which cover almost all
commonly used Internet services:

  - GNU Social for decentralized social networking,
  - Mozilla Sync for synchronizing your web browsers,
  - ownCloud for file, contact and calendar synchronization,
  - Prosody and other free XMPP software for instant messaging,
  - ... (a longer list is `available <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_free_software_web_applications>`_)

However, by the time this document was written, there is no comprehensive documents which talks about systematically
setting up these software. For this reason, I started the Blowb project, which is a free document project on setting up
these free software in a systematic manner.

This document consists of instructions to set up a relatively comprehensive set of Internet services using existing free
software for you, your family and/or your organization.
